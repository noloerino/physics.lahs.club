## A simple orbital simulation.

Hello dear reader! I have no idea how you found this repo, but I hope you enjoy it. This is the code for physics.lahs.club, a website mostly coded by Jonathan Shi in the process of learning JS. lahs.club is hosted by Nicolas Chan, and you should go check it out.

The program is pretty much self-explanatory: it's a simple orbital simulator that puts a bunch of circles on pages and you can stare at it instead of paying attention in class.

More details and things you should know will be added in later versions. For now, this is just a placeholder.
